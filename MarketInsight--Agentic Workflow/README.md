📈 Market Insight

Market Insight is an AI-powered stock market analysis platform that provides real-time financial data, company fundamentals, and market intelligence through a conversational interface.

The platform uses an intelligent LangGraph ReAct agent integrated with financial tools powered by Yahoo Finance, allowing users to ask natural language questions about stocks, companies, and market trends.

🚀 Overview

Market Insight enables users to interact with stock market data using plain English. Instead of navigating multiple financial websites, users can ask questions like:

“What is the current price of AAPL?”

“Show me Tesla’s balance sheet”

“What are the latest news updates about NVIDIA?”

“Give analyst recommendations for Amazon”

The AI agent automatically selects the appropriate financial tools, fetches data, and presents concise, intelligent responses.
